## Instructions

* Go to [https://jqckie.github.io/lattitude/index.html](https://jqckie.github.io/lattitude/index.html) to view the page (based on the Python Weather API Analysis completed [HERE](https://github.com/jqckie/Weather-API-Analysis) )

## Background

Using HTML and CSS to create a data visualization dashboard.

## Details

The website consists of 7 pages:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A "Comparisons" page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
  * Is responsive and re-sizes depending on the browser size.
* A "Data" page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The top of every page has a navigation menu that:

* Displays the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
